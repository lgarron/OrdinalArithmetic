Ordinal Arithmetic Package for Mathematica

Started Mar 13, 2011 by Lucas Garron


Currently in notebook development. Eventual goal is to have a .m file that can handle full arithmetic in Cantor normal form.

A lot of definitions are still incomplete (i.e. missing cases). Arithmetic may fail, crash, enter infinite recursion, or do any of a number of things. But if an answer is produced, it should be correct.
